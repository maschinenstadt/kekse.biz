# kekse.biz
This is just my _private_ Homepage.

## .html
To be honest .. this is only the "./pages" directory of my tiny CMS: the content itself,
neither the PHP CMS itself nor the template(s) or anything.

## Updating the ./pages
If you are contributing updates, they will be visible after I have executed one specific
script on my server - `/usr/local/sbin/update.sh` will update (`git pull`) all of my Git
repositories.

So you can change my homepage's contents here, but it won't be visible instantanely; AND
you also can't change the template(s) itself, whose job is also to provide my navigation
(to select any of my "./pages").
